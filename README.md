# Task
* Data visualization
* Data cleaning
* Modeling
* Flask API

# Problem
Use given attributes to predict the drug consumption situation. Use binary classification by union of part of classes into one new class. "Never Used" and "Used over a Decade Ago" form class "Non-user" and all other classes form class "User".

# Data visualization
Using matplotlib and seaborn libraries to show relations between different variables and the targets.

For example : count of different classes for each drug, heat map showing correlation between the features, gender/age/education/ethnicity/country percentage comparaison, cross table using country and gender and ethnicity, relations between education/ethnicity and alcohol target, gender/age and cannabis/legal highs target, age and ecstasy target, pie chart of the frequency of using nicotine, number of observation and frequency for every consumption level of every drug, etc.

# Data cleaning
Changing drug classes into integer, rename columns, drop columns with low depedencies : nscore,escore,oscore,ascore,cscore and impulsive, convert some columns to string type and update data, modifying target into 0/1, etc.

# Modeling
Use the scikit-learn library, use different algorithms, different hyper parameters, do grid search.

Make train set and test set, scale the data, plot confusion matrix of the prediction, compare accurancy.

Models used : Logistic regression, Linear SVC, Random forest classifier, Decision Tree classifier, and KNN.

# Flask API
Transformation of the model into flask API, using the logistic model as example.

Save the model as pickle file, so that later to use it and call the predict function to get a prediction for the new input data. When running the logistic_api.py it first loads the created logistic pickle file. Predictions are made by passing a post JSON request to the created Flask web server which is on port 5000 by default. In logistic_api.py this request is received and a prediction is based on the already loaded prediction function of the model. It returns the prediction in JSON format.

Test example :

Send Post [[0.96082,-0.31685,-0.46725,0.80523,-0.84732,-1.01450,-1.37983,0.40148,0,0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]] we got a prediction of class 1 as output of the model.

Send Post [[0.24923,-0.31685,-0.67825,-0.30033,-1.55521,1.63088,-1.37983,-1.54858,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]] we got a prediction of class 0 as output of the model.

This API can be easily used by other people to use the machine learning model to get the results.
